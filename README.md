# Player Groups and Roles
The Player Groups and Roles dialog is a fairly simple UI dialog for Arma 3. It lists the name, group and role description of every player in the current multiplayer session. If the [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) mod is loaded, the weight of each player's equipment is displayed as well.<br>
Role descriptions following the naming scheme used by the [*Name Groups in Lobby*](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/wiki/Name-Groups-in-Lobby) system of the [CBA_A3](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3) mod are also supported.
